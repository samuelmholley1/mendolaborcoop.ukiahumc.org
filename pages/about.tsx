            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The Mendo Labor Cooperative was born from the recognition that unhoused and precariously housed 
              workers face unique challenges in the labor marketâ€”and that we're best positioned to create 
              solutions for ourselves.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In Mendocino County, rising housing costs and stagnant wages have pushed many working people 
              into homelessness. Rather than accepting charity-based approaches that treat symptoms, we chose 
              to organize as workers to address root causes of economic inequality.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our cooperative model puts worker ownership and democratic decision-making at the center. 
              We believe that those most impacted by economic injustice should lead the fight for change.
